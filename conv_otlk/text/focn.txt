<p>FOCN45 CWWG 161900 </p><p>SIGNIFICANT WEATHER DISCUSSION ISSUED BY THE PRAIRIE AND ARCTIC STORM PREDICTION CENTRE OF ENVIRONMENT CANADA AT 2:00 PM CDT SUNDAY JUNE 16 2024. </p><p> ALERTS IN EFFECT...RAINFALL WARNING FOR PARTS OF NORTHEASTERN SASKATCHEWAN AND NORTHWESTERN MANITOBA. SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THE ALBERTA MOUNTAIN PARKS. WIND WARNING FOR PARTS OF EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN. AIR QUALITY ALERT FOR FORT GOOD HOPE. </p><p> SYNOPTIC OVERVIEW...ALOFT, A BROAD AREA OF TROUGHING IS OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN ARCTIC AND THROUGH SASKATCHEWAN, ALBERTA AND BC. WITHIN THE BROAD TROUGH ARE UPPER LOWS OVER THE HIGH ARCTIC, SOUTHERN NWT, CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN, SOUTHEASTERN BAFFIN ISLAND AND WESTERN WASHINGTON STATE. BROAD UPPER RIDGING THROUGH HUDSON BAY SOUTH TO ONTARIO AND QUEBEC. </p><p> AT THE SURFACE, A 987 MB LOW IS OVER EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN. A COLD FRONT STRETCHES SOUTHWARD FROM THIS LOW THROUGH TO NORTH DAKOTA, A WARM FRONT EXTENDS EASTWARD INTO NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO, AND A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH TO SOUTHWESTERN SASKATCHEWAN. AN OCCLUDED 997 MB LOW IS OVER FROBISHER BAY. </p><p> DISCUSSION... </p><p> AB...AN AREA OF SHOWERS CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL ALBERTA IS ALSO SLUMPING SOUTH AND EASTWARD. SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL IS NOT EXPECTED WITH THESE SHOWERS, ALTHOUGH 5-10 MM IS POSSIBLE IN THE FOOTHILLS AND EASTERN SLOPES. LOW FREEZING LEVELS MEAN THAT SOME INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECREATION AREAS IN THE MOUNTAIN PARKS RECEIVED A FEW CM OF SNOW OVERNIGHT, WITH A FURTHER 2-4 CM EXPECTED TODAY AND AGAIN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR THE MOUNTAIN PARKS. </p><p> THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER A FAIRLY BROAD PORTION OF ALBERTA TODAY, ALTHOUGH NO SEVERE STORMS ARE EXPECTED. EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ALBERTA. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO DEVELOP IN NORTHWESTERN ALBERTA THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MEAGER CAPE AND SHEAR, THESE STORMS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO REMAIN SUB-SEVERE. </p><p> SK/MB...THE LOW OVER EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN WILL TRACK NORTHWARD THROUGH THE DAY, PUSHING CONVECTIVE RAINFALL AND EMBEDDED NON-SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH NORTHERN MANITOBA. RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN DUE TO THE CONVECTIVE NATURE OF THE RAINFALL. THROUGH NORTHWESTERN MANITOBA, GENERAL 24 HR RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 20 TO 40 MM ARE FORECAST, BUT LOCALIZED AMOUNTS OF 50 MM ARE LIKELY, AND THEREFORE A RAINFALL WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED. THIS SITUATION WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY AND RAINFALL WARNINGS MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED, DEPENDING ON WHERE THE HEAVIEST CONVECTIVE RAINFALL SETS UP. </p><p> NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORECAST TODAY AS THE STORM ENVIRONMENT IS POLLUTED BY THE OVERNIGHT CONVECTION AND REMNANT CLOUD INHIBITING DAY TIME HEATING. GENERAL NON-SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORECAST THROUGH NORTHERN MANITOBA WITH THE LOW TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA AND BACK THROUGH MUCH OF SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN ALONG A TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE LOW. AS WELL, THE UPPER LOW OVER CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN WILL TRACK EASTWARD TODAY, TO BE COLLOCATED WITH THE SURFACE LOW NEAR THE PAS THIS AFTERNOON. THESE TWO FEATURES, COMBINED WITH THE MEAGER CAPE AND SHEAR OVER THE AREA ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUNNEL CLOUDS. THERE IS ALSO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF FUNNEL CLOUD DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE ISOBARIC TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN, ALTHOUGH AGAIN CLOUD COVER MAY INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT. </p><p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p><p> AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH NORTHERN MANITOBA TONIGHT, THE STRONG WINDS WILL FOLLOW AND BRING 70-80 KM/H SOUTHWESTERLY GUSTS TO NORTHEASTERN MANITOBA EARLY MONDAY MORNING. HOWEVER, CHURCHILL, GILLAM AND SHAMATTAWA SHOULD ESCAPE THE WORST OF THE WINDS AS THE LANDSCAPE SHOULD HELP TO SHELTER THESE SITES. </p><p> WESTERN ARCTIC...NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IS EXPECTED. CONDITIONS NEAR FORT GOOD HOPE WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED CLOSELY, OWING TO A LARGE FOREST FIRE BURNING NEAR THE COMMUNITY. REDUCED VISIBILITY IN SMOKE WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WITH DRASTICALLY REDUCED AIR QUALITY. </p><p> EASTERN ARCTIC...SNOW WILL CONTINUE TODAY THROUGH SOUTHERN BAFFIN ISLAND AND MELVILLE PENINSULA. SNOW WILL ACCUMULATE ON THE GROUND, BUT TEMPERATURES WILL BE AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE ZERO, SO AMOUNTS WILL BE MITIGATED BY MELTING AND COMPACTION. </p><p> THE KIVALLIQ WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED BY THE SK LOW AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD. AS THE LOW RUNS INTO RIDGING OVER HUDSON BAY, A STRONG NORTHEASTERLY GRADIENT DEVELOPS AHEAD OF IT IMPACTING THE KIVALLIQ COAST BEGINNING TONIGHT. ONCE AGAIN, WIND GUSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 70-80 KM/H RANGE. A WIND WARNING IS NOT EXPECTED AS NORTHEASTERLY WINDS ARE NOT THE OPTIMAL DIRECTION FOR THE AREA. PRECIPITATION WILL ACCOMPANY THE WINDS AS WELL, WITH THE KIVALLIQ REGION GETTING ANYWHERE FROM 10-25 MM BY TUESDAY MORNING. RAIN MAY TRANSITION TO A RAIN/SNOW MIX AS TEMPERATURES APPROACH ZERO DEGREES. </p><p> END/COLANGELO/VAN LOCHEM </p> </p><p></p> </p><p></p> </p><p></p> </p><p></p> </p><p></p>
