SASKATCHEWAN AND NORTHWESTERN MANITOBA. SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT
FOR THE ALBERTA MOUNTAIN PARKS. WIND WARNING FOR PARTS OF
EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN.

SYNOPTIC OVERVIEW...ALOFT, A BROAD AREA OF TROUGHING IS OVER THE
CENTRAL AND EASTERN ARCTIC AND THROUGH SASKATCHEWAN, ALBERTA AND BC.
WITHIN THE BROAD TROUGH ARE UPPER LOWS OVER THE HIGH ARCTIC, CENTRAL
ARCTIC, CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN AND SOUTHERN BAFFIN ISLAND. BROAD UPPER
RIDGING IS OVER ONTARIO AND EASTERN MANITOBA.

AT THE SURFACE, A 987 MB LOW IS OVER EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN. A
COLD FRONT STRETCHES SOUTHWARD FROM THIS LOW THROUGH TO NORTH
DAKOTA, A WARM FRONT EXTENDS EASTWARD INTO NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO,
AND A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH TO SOUTHWESTERN
SASKATCHEWAN. AN OCCLUDED 997 MB LOW IS OVER FROBISHER BAY.

DISCUSSION...

AB...MODERATE RAINFALL CONTINUES OVER SOUTHERN ALBERTA THIS MORNING
ALONG THE TROUGH EXTENDING WESTWARD FROM THE LOW IN SASKATCHEWAN.
SITES EAST OF CALGARY RECEIVED BETWEEN 30 AND 45 MM OF RAIN
OVERNIGHT WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER, RADAR RETURNS HAVE WEAKENED AND
THE TROUGH IS MOVING MORE QUICKLY EASTWARD, SO RAINFALL WARNINGS IN
THE AREA HAVE BEEN ENDED. A FURTHER 5-10 MM IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING
MAINLY IN SOUTHEASTERN ALBERTA.

ANOTHER AREA OF SHOWERS CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL ALBERTA IS ALSO
SLUMPING SOUTH AND EASTWARD. SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL IS NOT EXPECTED
WITH THESE SHOWERS, ALTHOUGH 5-10 MM IS POSSIBLE IN THE FOOTHILLS
AND EASTERN SLOPES. HOWEVER, LOW FREEZING LEVELS MEAN THAT SOME
INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECREATION AREAS IN THE MOUNTAIN PARKS RECEIVED A
FEW CM OF SNOW OVERNIGHT, WITH A FURTHER 2-4 CM EXPECTED EARLY THIS
MORNING AND AGAIN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT
REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR THE MOUNTAIN PARKS.

THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER A FAIRLY BROAD PORTION OF ALBERTA
TODAY, ALTHOUGH NO SEVERE STORMS ARE EXPECTED. EMBEDDED
THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN ALBERTA. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP IN NORTHWESTERN ALBERTA THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MEAGRE CAPE AND
SHEAR, THESE STORMS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO REMAIN SUB-SEVERE.

SK/MB...THUNDERSTORMS THAT TRACKED INTO WESTERN MANITOBA LATE
SATURDAY EVENING PERSISTED THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT WITH THE AID OF A
STRENGHTENING LOW LEVEL JET. THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL WEAKEN THIS
MORNING AND EXIT THE AOR.

THE LOW OVER EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN WILL TRACK NORTHWARD THROUGH
THE DAY, PUSHING CONVECTIVE RAINFALL AND EMBEDDED NON-SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH NORTHERN MANITOBA. RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN DUE TO THE CONVECTIVE NATURE OF THE
RAINFALL. THROUGH NORTHWESTERN MANITOBA, GENERAL 24 HR RAINFALL
AMOUNTS OF 20 TO 40 MM ARE FORECAST, BUT LOCALIZED AMOUNTS OF 50 MM
ARE LIKELY, AND THEREFORE A RAINFALL WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED. THIS
SITUATION WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY AND RAINFALL WARNINGS MAY NEED
TO BE ADJUSTED, DEPENDING ON WHERE THE HEAVIEST CONVECTIVE RAINFALL
SETS UP.

NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORECAST TODAY AS THE STORM ENVIRONMENT
IS POLLUTED BY THE OVERNIGHT CONVECTION AND REMNANT CLOUD INHIBITING
DAY TIME HEATING. GENERAL NON-SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORECAST
THROUGH NORTHERN MANITOBA WITH THE LOW TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA
AND BACK THROUGH MUCH OF SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN ALONG A TROUGH
EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE LOW. AS WELL, THE UPPER LOW OVER
CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN WILL TRACK EASTWARD TODAY, TO BE COLLOCATED
WITH THE SURFACE LOW NEAR THE PAS THIS AFTERNOON. THESE TWO
FEATURES, COMBINED WITH THE MEAGER CAPE AND SHEAR OVER THE AREA ARE
CONDUCIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUNNEL CLOUDS.

ALSO OF NOTE, WILL BE THE WINDS THROUGH SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN
AND WESTERN MANITOBA TODAY. GUSTY WESTERLY/NORTHWESTERLY WINDS ON
THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW WILL SPREAD THROUGH SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN
THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON AND WESTERN MANITOBA LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WIDESPREAD WINDS OF 50 GUSTING TO 70/80 KM/H
ARE FORECAST, BUT 90+ KM/H WINDS ARE FORECAST FOR PARTS OF
EAST-CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN AND A WIND WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED.
DEPENDING ON HOW THE WINDS MATERIALIZE IN EASTERN SASKATCHEWAN, THE
WIND WARNINGS MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED INTO WESTERN MANITOBA LATER
TODAY.

WESTERN ARCTIC...NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IS EXPECTED.

EASTERN ARCTIC...SNOW WILL CONTINUE TODAY THROUGH SOUTHERN BAFFIN
ISLAND AND MELVILLE PENINSULA. SNOW WILL ACCUMULATE ON THE GROUND,
BUT TEMPERATURES WILL BE AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE ZERO, SO AMOUNTS WILL
BE MITIGATED BY MELTING AND COMPACTION.
