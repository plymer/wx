SIGNIFICANT WEATHER DISCUSSION ISSUED BY THE PRAIRIE AND ARCTIC STORM
PREDICTION CENTRE OF ENVIRONMENT CANADA AT 2:00 PM CDT MONDAY JUNE
17 2024.

ALERTS IN EFFECT...RAINFALL WARNING FOR PARTS OF NORTHWESTERN
MANITOBA. AIR QUALITY ALERT FOR FORT GOOD HOPE. WIND WARNINGS FOR
NORTHEASTERN MANITOBA.

SYNOPTIC OVERVIEW...ALOFT, BROAD TROUGHING ENVELOPS MOST OF THE
PRAIRIES WITH A PAIR OF UPPER LOWS; ONE OVER NORTHERN MANITOBA WITH A
SECONDARY UPPER LOW TO THE WEST OVER NORTHERN ALBERTA/SASKATCHEWAN.
A DIGGING TROUGH OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, WITH UPPER LOW OVER
IDAHO/WESTERN MONTANA. RIDGING OVER ONTARIO AND QUEBEC EXTENDING
NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS HUDSON STRAIT AND THE NORTHERN KIVALLIQ.
TROUGHING ACROSS BAFFIN ISLAND INTO THE CENTRAL ARCTIC. FINALLY, AN
UPPER RIDGE OVER ALASKA AND THE NORTHERN YUKON.

AT THE SURFACE, A 981 MB LOW OVER CHURCHILL WITH A DETACHED FRONTAL
WAVE TO THE EAST WITH THE WARM FRONT ARCING ACROSS HUDSON BAY.
THE COLD FRONT EXTENDS SOUTH THROUGH NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO AND A
TROWAL WRAPS BACK WEST AROUND THE UPPER LOW OVER NORTHERN ALBERTA.

DISCUSSION...

AB...A SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY OVER EAST CENTRAL BC WILL MOVE THROUGH
WESTERN ALBERTA TODAY AND TONIGHT. WITH A GENERAL NORTHERLY FLOW,
UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT WILL BRING RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS TO AREAS EAST
OF THE MOUNTAINS AND A FEW CM OF SNOW OVER HIGHER TERRAIN. THE
HIGHEST TOTAL RAINFALL IS EXPECTED IN SOUTHWESTERN ALBERTA, WHERE
10-20 MM IS EXPECTED BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL
DEPEND GREATLY ON ELEVATION, BUT AT VALLEY BOTTOMS THE SNOW TO LIQUID
RATIOS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN QUITE LOW. THUS, THE HIGHEST SNOWFALL
AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 2-4 CM IN THE KANANASKIS REGION OVERNIGHT
TONIGHT.

THUNDERSTORMS IN THE PROVINCE TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW THE
SEVERE THRESHOLD. THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD OF MARGINALLY SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA AHEAD OF THE
AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE, WHERE MIXED LAYER CAPE VALUES OF 300-500 J/
KG AND ROUGHLY 10-20 KTS OF SHEAR ARE AVAILABLE.

OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, CLEARING SKIES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SURFACE
RIDGE, COMBINED WITH A COLD TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE
PROVINCE, WILL LIKELY BRING SOME PATCHY FROST TO PARTS OF CENTRAL
AND WESTERN ALBERTA. A FROST ADVISORY IS EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED THIS
AFTERNOON FOR AFFECTED AREAS.

SK/MB...HEAVY RAINFALL OVER NORTHERN MANITOBA HAS GRADUALLY TAPERED
OFF OVERNIGHT AS THE LOW OVER NORTHERN MB CONTINUES TO TRAVEL
NORTHEAST TOWARDS HUDSON BAY. RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE TO TAPER OFF
OVER NORTHERN MANITOBA TODAY, ENDING THE RAINFALL WARNINGS OVER LAC
BROCHET AND TADOULE LAKE. IN THE WAKE OF THE LOW COMES A STRONG
PRESSURE GRADIENT GIVING RISE TO STRONG WESTERLY WINDS ALONG THE
SOUTHERN FLANK OF THE LOW WHERE CLEARING WILL BEGIN TAKING PLACE THIS
AFTERNOON. SOLAR INSOLATION AS A RESULT OF CLEARING CLOUDS WILL
RESULT IN A DEEPENING, UNSTABLE BOUNDARY LAYER GIVING RISE TO STRONG
WIND GUSTS BY MID-AFTERNOON OVER NORTHEASTERN MANITOBA THIS
AFTERNOON. SUSTAINED WINDS IN THE 60-70 KM/H RANGE AND GUSTS
EXCEEDING 90 KM/H ARE LIKELY BY MID AFTERNOON.

FURTHER SOUTH, THE TROUGH OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST WILL CONTINUE TO
DIG SOUTHEAST OVER THE NORTHWESTERN U.S. TODAY. LEE CYCLOGENESIS WILL
TAKE PLACE OVER WYOMING/COLORADO TODAY, WITH A SURFACE TROUGH
EXTENDING NORTH INTO SOUTHERN MT/SK. THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO
MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN MT TODAY SUPPORTING AN AREA OF ORGANIZED RAIN/
SHOWERS OVER SOUTHERN SK. THIS AREA OF PRECIPITATION WILL TRANSLATE
EASTWARD ACROSS SOUTHERN SK THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY AND PHASE IN
WITH THE WYOMING/COLORADO LOW APPROACHING SOUTHERN MANITOBA OVERNIGHT
TONIGHT. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 5-10 MM RANGE FOR
SOUTHERN SK/MB, BUT EMBEDDED ELEVATED CONVECTION LOOKS TO AUGMENT
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS OVER PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN SK/SOUTHERN MB
OVERNIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY MORNING WITH AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 10-20 MM
WITH LOCAL POCKETS OF 30 MM+ UNDER HEAVIER PRECIPITATION BANDS.

TODAY LOOKS TO BE A QUIET DAY FOR THE THUNDERSTORM THREAT ACROSS SK/
MB. STRONG WESTERLY WINDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION SUNDAY HAVE
STABILIZED THE SOUTHERN PRAIRIES LEAVING A MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF
INSTABILITY TO WORK WITH. SHOWERS OVER WESTERN SK WILL DEVELOP THIS
AFTERNOON WITH A FEW STRIKES POSSIBLE WITH STRONGER UPDRAFTS THAT CAN
DEVELOP UNDER AREAS WITH CLEAR SKIES AND ALONG THE APPROACHING UPPER
LOW OVER NORTHERN AB. STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP ARE NOT EXPECTED TO
REACH SEVERE STATUS.

ON THE NOTE OF THE DRY AIR AND RECENT COLD AIR ADVECTION OVER SK,
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL DIP DOWN BELOW 4 DEGREES ACROSS THE NORTHWESTERN
GRAINBELT TONIGHT. OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE FORECAST TO BE IN THE 2-3
DEGREE RANGE TONIGHT, SO THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF PATCHY FROST
TONIGHT OVER THE REGION.

WESTERN ARCTIC...A FIRE NEAR THE COMMUNITY OF FORT GOOD HOPE IS
CAUSING VERY POOR AIR QUALITY AND REDUCED VISIBILITIES AT TIMES TO
THAT COMMUNITY, AND IS SPREADING SMOKE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE CENTRAL
NT AS WELL. AN AIR QUALITY ALERT IS IN EFFECT FOR FORT GOOD HOPE, AND
CONDITIONS WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY IN NEIGHBOURING COMMUNITIES.

EASTERN ARCTIC...AS THE MANITOBA LOW MOVES INTO HUDSON BAY TODAY, THE
GRADIENT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW INCREASES AS IT COMPRESSES
AGAINST A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE TO THE NORTH. WINDS INCREASED EARLY THIS
MORNING IN ARVIAT WITH WIND GUSTS AROUND 80-90 KM/H. A WIND WARNING
WAS BEEN ISSUED BUT HAS SINCE BEEN ENDED AS THE STRONGEST WINDS HAVE
DIMINISHED. WINDS WILL ALSO BE STRONG FOR RANKIN INLET/WHALE COVE,
BUT THE TIMING OF THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL PEAK BY MID MORNING.
PRECIPITATION TYPING IS ALSO A CHALLENGE WITH THIS SYSTEM.
PRECIPITATION LOOKS TO START OUT AS RAIN BEFORE BECOMING A RAIN/SNOW
MIX THIS AFTERNOON, AND THEN CHANGING OVER TO SNOW THIS EVENING.
SNOWFALL TOTALS WILL BE IN THE 5-10 CM RANGE BY THE TIME THE LOW
PEELS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST AND BEGINS TO WEAKEN TUESDAY. SOME MODELS
ARE ALSO BEING OVERLY AGGRESSIVE WITH FREEZING RAIN FOR THESE
COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A NOTABLE LACK OF BELOW FREEZING
TEMPERATURES IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING LOW. THIS WILL LIKELY
LIMIT COLD AIR UNDERCUTTING THE OVERRIDING WARM AIR TO CREATE AND
ASSIST IN THE MAINTENANCE OF A LONG LIVED FREEZING RAIN EVENT.
SURFACE TEMPERATURES LOOK TO HOVER BETWEEN 0-2 DEGREES FOR THE MOST
PART TODAY BEFORE SLIPPING TO ZERO OR JUST BELOW ZERO THIS EVENING.

ELSEWHERE, FOG AND SHOWERS IN ONSHORE FLOW FOR MANY SITES ON BAFFIN
ISLAND AND THE MELVILLE PENINSULA.
